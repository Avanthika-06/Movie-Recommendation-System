# Movie-Recommendation-System
This Repository consists of a project that implements a Movie Recommendation System that suggests similar movies based on a given input movie. The system utilizes cosine similarity to measure the closeness between movie descriptions, such as plot summaries or metadata.

Key Features:

Uses a movie dataset to analyze and find similarities between films.

Implements cosine similarity to compare movies based on textual features.

Returns 30 recommended movies for a given input movie.

Efficient and scalable approach for personalized movie recommendations.

Technologies Used:

Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn)

Natural Language Processing (TF-IDF Vectorization)

Cosine Similarity for Measuring Relevance

Google Colab for execution 

This system can be enhanced with more advanced techniques like collaborative filtering, deep learning, or hybrid methods for improved accuracy. ðŸš€
